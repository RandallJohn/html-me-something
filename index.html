                    Quotes that I try to strive to live by:
                    <OL>
                      <li>I believe in structuring my life's ambitions accordingly through the famous words from Albert Einstein "The significant problems we face cannot be solved at the same level of thinking we were at when we created them".</li>
                      <li> I truly believe in living "an ever-learning lifestyle" guided by the quote from TS Eliot, "We must not cease from exploration and the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we began and to know the place for the first time."" </li>

                    My wife, Kimmy, has been my second shadow for more than 8 years. We actually grew up together going to the same high school, but it wasn't until a decade later (and after traveling/living across the US) that we would officially meet.We both had entirely different lives before we met up (again). Since that time (and now more than 8 years later), we have both gone back to school to earn second degrees, purchased multiple houses, made complete career shifts, watched (and even participated sometimes) while the other achieved some of our life goals, and have been fortunate to be able to travel the globe.

                     <p>I started my working career at age 8, running a business making classmates shoes look white again at school for 25 or 50 cents. Later at age 10, I began mowing lawns in my neighborhood. Two year later, I had 2 other kids working under me. In highschool I set up a job site cleaning program with a home builder who was building houses in my neighborhood. Later, this led to me having 4 kids working under me and I had expanded to 2 addittional clients (or house builders).</p>
                     <p>After graduating from business school I got picked up by a fortune 200 company that I interned for in college. I had made it, living the corporate life with for one of the biggest media companies in the world. But quickly therafter started my first 'side hussle' being a home builder subcontractor, I guess it was like fullfillig a <em>Entripreniour</em> need eventhough I didnt realize it the time. </p>
                     <p>.It wasn't until after a book fell into my hands that I understood that I tended to leaned naturally into the entrepreneur mindset. Rather it was because of my undiagnosed OCD tendency, or because I grew up with family businesses, I naturally had a way to look at my work as a "piece" of a bigger "puzzle".  I was engulfed with intrigue on how the ("bigger puzzle") could be built quicker and more efficiently if re-arranging all the pieces to fit better. I soon found myself not only focusing my time on the other pieces to make them work better with one and other, but also how other puzzles designed and how they worked better or worst. Than later I came understanding theory and strategy base styles to these puzzles, and how sometimes they (the puzzles) were sometimes pieces to a larger puzzle, and that by themself they appear to be *1 thing, but when stepping back and seeing their role as a piece in the (BIGGER PUZZLE), the overall image was something completely different. I was hooked and couldn't look at a puzzle piece again the same, without thinking of the "macro" effect of the 'micro' piece.</p>

                I am a visual learner, I have been able to harmonize my creative talents pretty well. When I was in high school, all my teachers and counselors knew I was going to an Art School. Heck I didn't even know the requirements for anything else, I had never taking a Standardized test (ACT or SAT), nor knew I should.                 
                 <br><br>It wasn't until after visiting a highly acclaimed Art Institute I was considering attending, that my perspective shifted (some call a paradigm shift). Sitting on a popular city block right outside the school were students with piles of artwork pieces which they were trying to sell. From a distance I could tell their work was far more advanced than mine (hell i hoped maybe I could get to that level one day). Seeing them trying to sell it opened my eyes to the reality that there probably wouldn't be much of a stable living going down this career path, well not one with a confidence level. I was at a crossroads, go down this path whose future was sitting there on the street, or enroll in a formal education. I started the latter journey (into what would be business school) with what felt like a half packed hiking backpack without any Standardized Test nor most of the enrollment requirements(ex foreign languages, advance math) 
                 <br><br> Even while studying all the quantitative measures of business, I often found my self equally interested in trend forecasting and brand adaption. I truely am drawn to studying how market plans and strategic buisness plans are developed to take a competive advantage of future trends. My art portfolio's biggest asset was my ability for compostiion. In every area, draw, paint, sculpt, etc... I could produce as good as any, but where I shined was in my ability to take the media into a direction that encompassed the theme for more than others (sometimes by using less too). 
                 <br><br> I see this spills over to business and technology. I recognize how the puzzle piece (technology) fits into the bigger puzzle (today’s business ecosystem) and how that puzzle can be a larger one (macro-sociological forecasting). In college technology was so new it wasn't widely accepted nor had it matured enough for ease of penetration into the fabric of our lives yet. Most everything was static, and you needed a big box to work with it. I saw its potential at the time, but decided to wait to fully grasp it until I could fully utilize the medium to create my new, "puzzle”, compositions. So here I am a learning how to computer code (put puzzles pieces together) so I can play along putting puzzles together with the next generation who have <em>ONLY</em>grown up with these types of puzzles.              </p>
